# Translator
Communication gaps are quite prevalent in our country because of the linguistic diversity. Through this project, we can reduce the communication issues faced by us in our day to day lives by utilising the technology of automatic language translation. This repository holds the code for the implementation of Speech to Speech Translation in python. With the help of this product, the user can translate from any language to any language as required by the user.
