# Translator
Communication gaps are quite prevalent in our country because of the linguistic diversity. Through this project, we can reduce the communication issues faced by us in our day to day lives by utilising the technology of automatic language translation. This repository holds the code for the implementation of Speech to Speech Translation in python. With the help of this product, the user can translate from any language to any language as required by the user.

NOTE - The dafault language to which the input will be translated is Hindi.

## Steps Involved
- Imported the required modules.

- Initialised the class variables.

- Audio input is taken and converted into a text.

- The text is translated to the required language.
